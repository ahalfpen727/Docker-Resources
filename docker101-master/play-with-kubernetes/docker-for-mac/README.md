# Kubernetes powered Docker for Mac 17.12 CE Edition

## How ```docker stack deploy``` manage to deploy to K8s? Does it convert docker-compose files to k8s manifests (something like kompose) before deployment ?

It’s a custom apiserver that is in charge of keeping your stack up and running. Basically converting services to k8s objets and maintaining them (if you remove a deployment of a stack, the compose controller will recreate it)

One can do kubectl get stacks for instance and scale it by hand.

## How you add things to K8s API?

The Kubernetes API server validates and configures data for the api objects which include pods, services, replicationcontrollers, and others. The API Server services REST operations and provides the frontend to the cluster’s shared state through which all other components interact.

Docker use api aggregation. In Kubernetes, you can add new things to the api with this mechanism.

## What happens behind the scene while you run ```docker stack deploy```?

Docker introduced a new type : Stack, under compose.docker.com. This object, that you can create with kubectl or more easily with docker stack deploy, contains the compose file.

Behind the scene, a controller watches for stacks and create/update corresponding kubernetes objets (deployments, services, etc).
The job of the controller is to reconcile the stacks (stored in the api-server or crd) with k8s native object

kubectl has a discovery mechanism, nothing more. You can list all apis available with `kubectl api-versions`

  # Describe a pod
  kubectl describe pods/nginx
  
  # Describe a pod identified by type and name in "pod.json"
  kubectl describe -f pod.json
  
  # Describe all pods
  kubectl describe pods
  
  # Describe pods by label name=myLabel
  kubectl describe po -l name=myLabel
  
  # Describe all pods managed by the 'frontend' replication controller (rc-created pods
  # get the name of the rc as a prefix in the pod the name).
  kubectl describe pods frontend
