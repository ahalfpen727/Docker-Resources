The creation of Docker images is specified by a *Dockerfile*. This is a text file containing the sequence of instructions required to re-create your image from some starting point, which could be the standard Ubuntu image. Essentially we list the commands we use, step-by-step to install all the software required. If you already have a shell script to install your software, then translating to a Dockerfile is relatively painless.

In this section we show how to create a Dockerfile and use this file to build a docker image. A useful reference is the official [Docker documentation on Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/), which goes into far more detail than we will here.

In this example we show the ***Dockerfile*** used to create a Ubuntu image with the `build-essential` and `wget` tools installed. 


```{bash eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
cat Dockerfile
```

The `FROM` instruction is mandatory as it defines the starting point for your image. It is good practice to have a contact address too.

The remaining lines of the file are the command line steps you would run in order to create the image. 

The `docker build` command is then used to build an image that we can use. The argument `-t` in this case specifies a name for the image (tag?) and traditionally the `Dockerfile` is located in the current directory. The current directory will also be used to define the *context*, meaning you can include files or directories on your local machine in the image. Note that we do not need a `sudo` as the image is built with super-user privileges.

```{bash}
docker build -t="docker-test/ubuntu-build-essential" .
```

To create a `Dockerfile` for our samtools image, we can firstly take advantage of the `build-essential` image that we just created to ensure we have `wget` and the `build-essential` tools available.

```{bash eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
cat Dockerfile.samtools
```

The remaining steps translate the steps we used in the previous section to the `Dockerfile` syntax. The only tricky bit is to change directory you need the `WORKDIR` command rather than a unix `cd` command.

```{bash}
docker build -t="docker-test/samtools" -f Dockerfile.samtools .
```

We already mentioned that 'dockerhub' is a repository where people can distribute their docker containers. You can easily sign-up for a dockerhub account if you already have github. Then any container can be pushed with the `docker push` command. Here, I tag my image with the prefix `markdunning` (which is my github and dockerhub account)


```{bash}
docker build -t="markdunning/ubuntu-build-essential" .
docker push markdunning/ubuntu-build-essential
```

The container is then [available on dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/markdunning/ubuntu-build-essential/)

N.B. you'll notice the image builds much quicker because it has already been built once. To stop this behaviour you can specify the `--no-cache` option

In fact, you can build images from a github repository with [Automated Builds](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/)

There are more commands available in a Dockerfile, as described in the [reference guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/). Some particular ones I have used, or encountered...

- `USER` to change the user

- `ENV` to create an environment variable
    + e.g. to link to a particular java file
    
```{bash}
ENV PICARD /opt/picard-tools....
```

- `ENTRYPOINT` change what command is automatically run
    + e.g. the sanger cgpbox is defined to run a particular script
    
```{bash}
ENTRYPOINT $OPT/bin/runCgp.sh
```

- `EXPOSE` make a particular port number available
